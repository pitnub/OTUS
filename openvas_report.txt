NVT:    Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108010
Threat: High (CVSS: 10.0)
Port:   8787/tcp

Summary:
Systems using Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb), which is available in Ruby versions !
1.6
  and later, may permit unauthorized systems to execute distributed commands.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The service is running in $SAFE >= 1 mode. However it is still possible to run a!
rbitrary syscall commands on the remote host. Sending an invalid syscall the ser!
vice returned the following response:

Impact:
By default, Distributed Ruby does not impose restrictions on allowed hosts or se!
t the
  $SAFE environment variable to prevent privileged activities. If other controls!
 are not in place, especially if the
  Distributed Ruby process runs with elevated privileges, an attacker could exec!
ute arbitrary system commands or Ruby
  scripts on the Distributed Ruby server. An attacker may need to know only the !
URI of the listening Distributed Ruby
  server to submit Ruby commands.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Administrators of environments that rely on Distributed Ruby should ensure that
  appropriate controls are in place. Code-level controls may include:
  - Implementing taint on untrusted input
  - Setting $SAFE levels appropriately (>=2 is recommended if untrusted hosts ar!
e allowed to submit Ruby commands, and >=3 may be appropriate)
  - Including drb/acl.rb to set ACLEntry to restrict access to trusted hosts

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Send a crafted command to the service and check for a remote command execution
  via the instance_eval or syscall requests.

  Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the Datagram
  Transport Layer Security (DTLS) implementation in OpenSSL performed a
  MAC check only if certain padding is valid. This could allow a remote
  attacker to recover plaintext. (CVE-2011-4108)
  Antonio Martin discovered that a flaw existed in the fix to address
  CVE-2011-4108, the DTLS MAC check failure. This could allow a remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0050)
  Ben Laurie discovered a double free vulnerability in OpenSSL that could
  be triggered when the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag is enabled. This

  and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-4109)
  It was discovered that OpenSSL, in certain circumstances involving
  ECDH or ECDHE cipher suites, used an incorrect modular reduction
  algorithm in its implementation of the P-256 and P-384 NIST elliptic
  curves. This could allow a remote attacker to obtain the private
  key of a TLS server via multiple handshake attempts. This issue only
  affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2011-4354)
  Adam Langley discovered that the SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL
  did not properly initialize data structures for block cipher
  padding. This could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
  information. (CVE-2011-4576)
  Andrew Chi discovered that OpenSSL, when RFC 3779 support is enabled,
  could trigger an assert when handling an X.509 certificate containing
  certificate-extension data associated with IP address blocks or
  Autonomous System (AS) identifiers. This could allow a remote attacker
  to cause a denial of servi ...

Threat: High (CVSS: 7.5)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1358-1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: php5-cgi
Installed version:  5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10
Fixed version:      5.2.4-2ubuntu5.22

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
php5 on Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
It was discovered that PHP computed hash values for form parameters
  without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.
  This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by
  sending many crafted parameters. (CVE-2011-4885)
  ATTENTION: this update changes previous PHP behavior by
  limiting the number of external input variables to 1000.
  This may be increased by adding a 'max_input_vars'
  directive to the php.ini configuration file. See
  the references for more information.
  Stefan Esser discovered that the fix to address the predictable hash
  collision issue, CVE-2011-4885, did not properly handle the situation
  where the limit was reached. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a request
  containing a large number of variables. (CVE-2012-0830)
  It was discovered that PHP did not always check the return value of
  the zend_strndup function. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4153)
  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce libxslt security
  settings. This could allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary
  files via a crafted XSLT stylesheet that uses the libxslt output
  extension. (CVE-2012-0057)
  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce that PDORow
  objects could not be serialized and not be saved in a session. A
  remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service via an
  application crash. (CVE-2012-0788)
  It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to
  be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass
  restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection. (CVE-2012-0831)
  USN 1126-1 addressed an issue where the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job
  for PHP allowed local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
  attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. Emese Revfy discovered
  that the fix had not been applied to PHP for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This
  update corrects the issue. We apologize for the error. (CVE-2011-0441)

  Wesley Miaw discovered that when zlib is enabled, libcurl does not
  properly restrict the amount of callback data sent to an application
  that requests automatic decompression. This might allow an attacker to
  cause a denial of service via an application crash or possibly execute
  arbitrary code with the privilege of the application. This issue only
  affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-0734)
  USN 818-1 fixed an issue with curl's handling of SSL certificates with
  zero bytes in the Common Name. Due to a packaging error, the fix for
  this issue was not being applied during the build. This issue only
  affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. We apologize for the error. (CVE-2009-2417)
  Original advisory details:
  Scott Cantor discovered that curl did not correctly handle SSL
  certificates with zero bytes in the Common Name. A remote attacker
  could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view
  sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1437-1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: php5-cgi
Installed version:  5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10
Fixed version:      5.2.4-2ubuntu5.24

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
php5 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 11.10,
  Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor
  for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query
  strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
  running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using
  mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.
  This update addresses the issue when the PHP CGI interpreter
  is configured using mod_cgi and mod_actions as described
  in /usr/share/doc/php5-cgi/README.Debian.gz. However,
  if an alternate configuration is used to enable PHP CGI
  processing, it should be reviewed to ensure that command line
  arguments cannot be passed to the PHP interpreter. Please see
  the references for more details and potential mitigation approaches.

  Ubuntu 10.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
Mateusz Kocielski, Marek Kroemeke and Filip Palian discovered that a
  stack-based buffer overflow existed in the socket_connect function's
  handling of long pathnames for AF_UNIX sockets. A remote attacker
  might be able to exploit this to execute arbitrary code. However,
  the default compiler options for affected releases should reduce
  the vulnerability to a denial of service. This issue affected Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1938)
  Krzysztof Kotowicz discovered that the PHP post handler function
  does not properly restrict filenames in multipart/form-data POST
  requests. This may allow remote attackers to conduct absolute
  path traversal attacks and possibly create or overwrite arbitrary
  files. This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu
  10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-2202)
  It was discovered that the crypt function for blowfish does not
  properly handle 8-bit characters. This could make it easier for an
  attacker to discover a cleartext password containing an 8-bit character
  that has a matching blowfish crypt value. This issue affected Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-2483)
  It was discovered that PHP did not properly check the return values of
  the malloc(3), calloc(3) and realloc(3) library functions in multiple
  locations. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service
  via a NULL pointer dereference or possibly execute arbitrary code.
  This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10
  and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-3182)
  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that PHP did not properly implement
  the error_log function. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial
  of service via an application crash. This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04
  LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2011-3267)
  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the ZipArchive functions
  addGlob() and addPattern() did not properly check their flag arguments.
  This could allow a malicious script author to cause a denial of
  service via application crash. This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2011-1657)
  It was discovered that the Xend opcode parser in PHP could be interrupted
  while handling the shift-left, shift-right, and bitwise-xor opcodes.
  This could allow a malicious script author to expose memory
  contents. This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-1914)
  It was discovered that the strrchr function in PHP could be interrupted
  by a malicious script, allowing the exposure of memory contents. This
  issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-2484)

NVT:    Ubuntu Update for php5 USN-1358-2
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.840895
Threat: High (CVSS: 7.5)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1358-2

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: php5-cgi
Installed version:  5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10
Fixed version:      5.2.4-2ubuntu5.23

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
php5 on Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
USN 1358-1 fixed multiple vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for
  CVE-2012-0831 introduced a regression where the state of the
  magic_quotes_gpc setting was not correctly reflected when calling
  the ini_get() function.
  We apologize for the inconvenience.
  Original advisory details:
  It was discovered that PHP computed hash values for form parameters
  without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.
  This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by
  sending many crafted parameters. (CVE-2011-4885)
  ATTENTION: this update changes previous PHP behavior by
  limiting the number of external input variables to 1000.
  This may be increased by adding a 'max_input_vars'
  directive to the php.ini configuration file. See
  the references for more information.
  Stefan Esser discovered that the fix to address the predictable hash
  collision issue, CVE-2011-4885, did not properly handle the situation
  where the limit was reached. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a request
  containing a large number of variables. (CVE-2012-0830)
  It was discovered that PHP did not always check the return value of
  the zend_strndup function. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4153)
  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce libxslt security
  settings. This could allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary
  files via a crafted XSLT stylesheet that uses the libxslt output
  extension. (CVE-2012-0057)
  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce that PDORow
  objects could not be serialized and not be saved in a session. A
  remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service via an
  application crash. (CVE-2012-0788)
  It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to
  be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass
  restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection. (CVE-2012-0831)
  USN 1126-1 addressed an issue where the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job
  for PHP allowed local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
  attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. Emese Revfy discovered
  that the fix had not been applied to PHP for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This
  update corrects the issue. We apologize for the error. (CVE-2011-0441)

Vulnerability Insight:
USN 1126-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for
  CVE-2010-4697 introduced an incorrect reference counting regression
  in the Zend engine that caused the PHP interpreter to segfault. This
  regression affects Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.
  The fixes for CVE-2011-1072 and CVE-2011-1144 introduced a regression
  in the PEAR installer that prevented it from creating its cache
  directory and reporting errors correctly.
  We apologize for the inconvenience.
  Original advisory details:
  Stephane Chazelas discovered that the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job for
  PHP 5.3.5 allows local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
  attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. (CVE-2011-0441)
  Raphael Geisert and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the PEAR installer
  allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on
  the package.xml file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir,
  (3) tmp_dir, and (4) pear-build-download directories. (CVE-2011-1072,
  CVE-2011-1144)
  Ben Schmidt discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability in the PHP
  Zend engine could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (heap
  memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-4697)
  Martin Barbella discovered a buffer overflow in the PHP GD extension
  that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash)
  via a large number of anti- aliasing steps in an argument to the
  imagepstext function. (CVE-2010-4698)
  It was discovered that PHP accepts the \0 character in a pathname,
  which might allow an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions
  by placing a safe file extension after this character. This issue
  is addressed in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04.
  (CVE-2006-7243)
  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the grapheme_extract function
  in the PHP Internationalization extension (Intl) for ICU allow
  an attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid
  size argument, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference. This
  issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu
  11.04. (CVE-2011-0420)
  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the _zip_name_locate
  function in the PHP Zip extension does not properly handle a
  ZIPARCHIVE::FL_UNCHANGED argument, which might allow an attacker to
  cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via an empty
  ZIP archive. This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04. ( ...

Vulnerability Insight:
It was discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle
  integer overflows in the timezone handling code. An attacker could use
  this to possibly execute arbitrary code by convincing an application
  to load a maliciously constructed tzfile. (CVE-2009-5029)
  It was discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle
  passwd.adjunct.byname map entries in the Network Information Service
  (NIS) code in the name service caching daemon (nscd). An attacker
  could use this to obtain the encrypted passwords of NIS accounts.
  This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-0015)
  Chris Evans reported that the GNU C Library did not properly
  calculate the amount of memory to allocate in the fnmatch() code. An
  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code via a maliciously crafted UTF-8 string.
  This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu
  10.10. (CVE-2011-1071)
  Tomas Hoger reported that an additional integer overflow was possible

NVT:    PHP-CGI-based setups vulnerability when parsing query string parameters from php files.
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103482
Threat: High (CVSS: 7.5)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
PHP is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable url: http://host-192-168-51-99.soho.net.ua/cgi-bin/php

Impact:
Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to view the source code of files i!
n the
  context of the server process. This may allow the attacker to obtain sensitive!
 information and to run arbitrary PHP code
  on the affected computer. Other attacks are also possible.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
PHP has released version 5.4.3 and 5.3.13 to address this vulnerability.
  PHP is recommending that users upgrade to the latest version of PHP.

Vulnerability Insight:
When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's mod_cgid), the
  php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line
  arguments which allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be
  passed to the php-cgi binary, which can be exploited to disclose source
  code and obtain arbitrary code execution.
  An example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source code
  of index.php is below:
  http://example.com/index.php?-s

  specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary
  code with user privileges, or crash the application, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2012-1173)
  It was discovered that the tiffdump utility incorrectly handled directory
  data structures with many directory entries. If a user or automated system
  were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker
  could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly
  execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue only applied to
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04.

Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
update-manager on Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
USN-1284-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Update Manager. One of the fixes
  introduced a regression for Kubuntu users attempting to upgrade to a newer
  Ubuntu release. This update fixes the problem.
  We apologize for the inconvenience.
  Original advisory details:
  David Black discovered that Update Manager incorrectly extracted the
  downloaded upgrade tarball before verifying its GPG signature. If a remote
  attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could
  potentially be used to replace arbitrary files. (CVE-2011-3152)
  David Black discovered that Update Manager created a temporary directory
  in an insecure fashion. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  read the XAUTHORITY file of the user performing the upgrade.
  (CVE-2011-3154)
  This update also adds a hotfix to Update Notifier to handle cases where the
  upgrade is being performed from CD media.

NVT:    Anonymous FTP Login Reporting
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.900600
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 6.4)
Port:   21/tcp

Summary:
Reports if the remote FTP Server allows anonymous logins.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was possible to login to the remote FTP service with the following anonymous !
account(s):
anonymous:anonymous@example.com
ftp:anonymous@example.com

Impact:
Based on the files accessible via this anonymous FTP login and the permissions
  of this account an attacker might be able to:
  - gain access to sensitive files
  - upload or delete files.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
If you do not want to share files, you should disable anonymous logins.

Vulnerability Insight:
A host that provides an FTP service may additionally provide Anonymous FTP
  access as well. Under this arrangement, users do not strictly need an account !
on the host. Instead the user
  typically enters 'anonymous' or 'ftp' when prompted for username. Although use!
rs are commonly asked to send
  their email address as their password, little to no verification is actually p!
erformed on the supplied data.

It was discovered that the mod_proxy module in Apache did not properly
  interact with the RewriteRule and ProxyPassMatch pattern matches
  in the configuration of a reverse proxy. This could allow remote
  attackers to contact internal webservers behind the proxy that were
  not intended for external exposure. (CVE-2011-3368)
  Stefano Nichele discovered that the mod_proxy_ajp module in Apache when
  used with mod_proxy_balancer in certain configurations could allow
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a malformed HTTP
  request. (CVE-2011-3348)
  Samuel Montosa discovered that the ITK Multi-Processing Module for
  Apache did not properly handle certain configuration sections that
  specify NiceValue but not AssignUserID, preventing Apache from dropping
  privileges correctly. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu
  10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1176)

Installed version:  2.2.8-1ubuntu0.15
Fixed version:      2.2.8-1ubuntu0.25

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
apache2 on Ubuntu 12.10,
  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 11.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
Niels Heinen discovered that multiple modules incorrectly sanitized certain
  strings, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site
  scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting
  vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a
  crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the
  contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same
  domain. (CVE-2012-3499, CVE-2012-4558)
  It was discovered that the mod_proxy_ajp module incorrectly handled error
  states. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to stop
  responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.10. (CVE-2012-4557)
  It was discovered that the apache2ctl script shipped in Ubuntu packages
  incorrectly created the lock directory. A local attacker could possibly use
  this issue to gain privileges. The symlink protections in Ubuntu 11.10 and
  later should reduce this vulnerability to a denial of service.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: 'DHE_EXPORT' Man in the Middle Security Bypass Vulnerability (LogJam)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.805188
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   25/tcp

Summary:
This host is accepting 'DHE_EXPORT' cipher suites
  and is prone to man in the middle attack.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'DHE_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the SSLv3 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
'DHE_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

Impact:
Successful exploitation will allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade the security of a TLS session to
  512-bit export-grade cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing
  the attacker to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with
  the encrypted stream.

NVT:    SSH Weak Encryption Algorithms Supported
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105611
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   22/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow weak encryption algorithms.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following weak client-to-server encryption algorithms are supported by the r!
emote service:
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc
aes192-cbc
aes256-cbc
arcfour
arcfour128
arcfour256
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc

The following weak server-to-client encryption algorithms are supported by the r!
emote service:
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc
aes192-cbc
aes256-cbc
arcfour
arcfour128
arcfour256
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc
rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the weak encryption algorithms.

Vulnerability Insight:
The `arcfour` cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
  The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]!
. Arcfour (and RC4) has problems
  with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.
  The `none` algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done.
  Note that this method provides no confidentiality protection, and it
  is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.
  A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an !
attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check if remote ssh service supports Arcfour, none or CBC ciphers.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103440
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   5432/tcp

Summary:
This routine reports all Weak SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted by a service.
  NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher s!
uites on port 25/tcp is reported.
  If too strong cipher suites are configured for this service the alternative wo!
uld be to fall back to an even more insecure
  cleartext communication.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the SSLv3 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
The configuration of this services should be changed so
  that it does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.
  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

Vulnerability Insight:
These rules are applied for the evaluation of the cryptographic strength:
  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808).
  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force !
methods
  and therefore considered as weak (CVE-2015-4000).
  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as we!
ak.
  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered !
as medium
  - Any other cipher is considered as strong

NVT:    SSL/TLS: RSA Temporary Key Handling 'RSA_EXPORT' Downgrade Issue (FREAK)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.805142
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   25/tcp

Summary:
This host is accepting 'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites
  and is prone to man in the middle attack.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the SSLv3 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Certificate Signed Using A Weak Signature Algorithm
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105880
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.0)
Port:   5432/tcp

Summary:
The remote service is using a SSL/TLS certificate in the certificate chain that !
has been signed using a
  cryptographically weak hashing algorithm.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following certificates are part of the certificate chain but using insecure !
signature algorithms:
Subject:              1.2.840.113549.1.9.1=#726F6F74407562756E74753830342D626173!

ion of Otherwise Simple Affairs,O=OCOSA,L=Everywhere,ST=There is no such thing o!
utside US,C=XX
Signature Algorithm:  sha1WithRSAEncryption

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Servers that use SSL/TLS certificates signed with a weak SHA-1, MD5, MD4 or MD2 !
hashing algorithm will need to obtain new
  SHA-2 signed SSL/TLS certificates to avoid web browser SSL/TLS certificate war!
nings.

Vulnerability Insight:
The following hashing algorithms used for signing SSL/TLS certificates are consi!
dered cryptographically weak
  and not secure enough for ongoing use:
  - Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
  - Message Digest 5 (MD5)
  - Message Digest 4 (MD4)
  - Message Digest 2 (MD2)
  Beginning as late as January 2017 and as early as June 2016, browser developer!
s such as Microsoft and Google will begin warning users when visiting
  web sites that use SHA-1 signed Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates.
  NOTE: The script preference allows to set one or more custom SHA-1 fingerprint!
s of CA certificates which are trusted by this routine. The fingerprints
  needs to be passed comma-separated and case-insensitive:
  Fingerprint1
  or
  fingerprint1,Fingerprint2

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check which hashing algorithm was used to sign the remote SSL/TLS certificate.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient DH Group Strength Vulnerability
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.106223
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.0)
Port:   5432/tcp

Summary:
The SSL/TLS service uses Diffie-Hellman groups with insufficient strength
  (key size < 2048).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Server Temporary Key Size: 1024 bits

Impact:
An attacker might be able to decrypt the SSL/TLS communication offline.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
Deploy (Ephemeral) Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or use
  a 2048-bit or stronger Diffie-Hellman group (see the references).
  For Apache Web Servers:
  Beginning with version 2.4.7, mod_ssl will use DH parameters which include pri!
mes with lengths of more than 1024 bits.

Vulnerability Insight:
The Diffie-Hellman group are some big numbers that are used as base for
  the DH computations. They can be, and often are, fixed. The security of the fi!
nal secret depends on the size
  of these parameters. It was found that 512 and 768 bits to be weak, 1024 bits !
to be breakable by really
  powerful attackers like governments.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the DHE temporary public key size.

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 217889
Packet 2: 217997

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP/IPv4 implementations that implement RFC1323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

NVT:    Ubuntu Update for apt USN-1283-1
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.840825
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1283-1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: apt
Installed version:  0.7.9ubuntu17
Fixed version:      0.7.9ubuntu17.4

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
apt on Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled the Verify-Host
  configuration option. If a remote attacker were able to perform a
  man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to steal
  repository credentials. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and
  10.10. (CVE-2011-3634)
  USN-1215-1 fixed a vulnerability in APT by disabling the apt-key net-update
  option. This update re-enables the option with corrected verification.
  Original advisory details:
  It was discovered that the apt-key utility incorrectly verified GPG
  keys when downloaded via the net-update option. If a remote attacker were
  able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be
  used to install altered packages.

Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1477-1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: apt
Installed version:  0.7.9ubuntu17
Fixed version:      0.7.9ubuntu17.6

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix

Affected Software/OS:
apt on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 11.10,
  Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
Georgi Guninski discovered that APT did not properly validate imported
  keyrings via apt-key net-update. USN-1475-1 added additional verification
  for imported keyrings, but it was insufficient. If a remote attacker were
  able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be
  used to install altered packages. This update corrects the issue by
  disabling the net-update option completely. A future update will re-enable
  the option with corrected verification.

NVT:    Ubuntu Update for apache2 USN-1627-1
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.841209
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1627-1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: apache2.2-common
Installed version:  2.2.8-1ubuntu0.15
Fixed version:      2.2.8-1ubuntu0.24

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Please Install the Updated Packages.

Affected Software/OS:
apache2 on Ubuntu 12.10,
  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 11.10,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
It was discovered that the mod_negotiation module incorrectly handled
  certain filenames, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to
  cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site
  scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server
  output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit
  this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as
  passwords), within the same domain. (CVE-2012-2687)
  It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server was vulnerable to the 'CRIME'
  SSL data compression attack. Although this issue had been mitigated on the
  client with newer web browsers, this update also disables SSL data
  compression on the server. A new SSLCompression directive for Apache has
  been backported that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in
  certain environments. (CVE-2012-4929)

Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Ubuntu Update for Linux kernel vulnerabilities USN-1475-1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Vulnerable package: apt
Installed version:  0.7.9ubuntu17

  Ubuntu 11.10,
  Ubuntu 11.04,
  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

Vulnerability Insight:
Georgi Guninski discovered that APT relied on GnuPG argument order and did
  not check GPG subkeys when validating imported keyrings via apt-key
  net-update. While it appears that a man-in-the-middle attacker cannot
  exploit this, as a hardening measure this update adjusts apt-key to
  validate all subkeys when checking for key collisions.
